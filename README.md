# Overview

This application is a simple app meant to translate integers into roman numerals
For example, if the input is "5", then the output is "V" since this is the equivalent in roman numerals.

# Requirements

The HTTP endpoint needs to accept the URI with an integer up to 2,200,000,000.

# Set up

Set up Docker

# Testing

There will be two aspects to testing, unit tests and end to end testing using cypress.
(Not sure the approach yet, maybe concatenate into a Makefile, maybe thats overkill.)
